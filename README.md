I'm particularly proud of this app because it's the successful outcome of solid trust, communication, and empathy during mob programming. This project was built using React and Firebase, and the styling was done in SASS. 

Although some of the API data leaves a bit to be desired, the minimum viable product was achieved, as well as a couple of stretch goals. Functional components were used wherever possible, and this project also made use of prop drilling and event bubbling.
